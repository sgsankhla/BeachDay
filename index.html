            <li>Well, there are a huge number of beaches in India that you can visit and explore. And while doing so,

                fun
                things that you can do.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>>Hello to the gorgeous companion of the beach, the unending sea. The sea offers you endless
                opportunities to

                even
                for kids
                in terms of water activities.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>After enjoying the thrilling water activities to do at the beach, you must be hungry. No worries! Most
                beaches house an array of food stalls where you can order delicious snacks and meals. We suggest you try
                seafood when you are visiting a beach. The authentic <b class="blink_me color">seafood</b> found on
                beaches is rare to find elsewhere.

        </p>

            <li>There are quite a few beaches from where you can watch dolphins on the sea. Watching these adorable
                creatures enjoy their natural habitat and play around is an endearing sight. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                A great way to enjoy a holiday is just by spending a lazy day relaxing and enjoying your company. What
                better place than a beach to do that! Lie down on the cushiony sand bed, wear your sunglasses and bask
                in the sunrays. Feeling the warmth of the sun while enjoying the beach scenes is quite rejuvenating.

    <section class="section section-light">
        <p> A place that I enjoy going to is the beach.. It is seen as a place of relaxation because it is normally
            quiet and peaceful there. To look around you and see the beauty of mother nature at it's finest. The
            majority of people you ask will say that it is one of their favorite vacation destinations. Not only for the
            beauty and relaxation but for the sheer entertainment. That is the three reasons I enjoy it as much as I do.
            I go to the beach to get away from all my troubles that are bothering me. To feel the grainy sand all under
            your toes. To sit there under the sun feeling the warmth of it beating down on your skin. To know that if
            you get too hot that you only have to walk about ten feet down until you get into the brisk cool ocean, and
            feel instant relief from the blistering sun. Also to lay on a float in the ocean and just feel the ocean as
            you are a part of it. Not only to feel but to hear the waves is the ultimate relaxation.
            The beach is not only known as a place to relax ,but as a place of beauty. Many of times you see artist
            portraying the beach with their paintings, or by singing about its magnificence and its splendor. No matter
            how descriptive nor how detailed the picture is though it can never capture the beauty that the beach really
            holds. Not only above but under the water also. The ocean is filled with many colorful and astonishing
            marine life.</p>
